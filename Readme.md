##Flopy Toth Demo

This repository contains a jupyter notebook example where the classical Toth model for a linearly sloping water table is simulated in *MODFLOW 2005*.  The example requires the use of the [Flopy](https://github.com/modflowpy/flopy) python package.  The repository contains reasonable instructions for installing flopy from scratch using conda, and local compilation and of Modflow 2005 using the [pymake](https://github.com/modflowpy/pymake)  (**./InstallingFlopy/InstallFlopy.md**).  


The Jupyter Notebook (**TothDemo.ipynb**) walks the user through the creation of the model, simulation, and finally visualization of the results.  The notebook is a useful introduction to both the very basics of MODFLOW 2005 simulation, and Flopy, for users new to MODFLOW and working with Flopy.
